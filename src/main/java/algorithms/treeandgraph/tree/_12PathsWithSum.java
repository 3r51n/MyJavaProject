Paths with Sum:
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value(which might be positive or negative).
Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value.
The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

                    10
            5               -3
      3           2              11
 3       -2           1

    Create separate output variables from root processing, left subtree processing and right subtree processing and then merge them as needed.
    Donâ€™t take a chance of using the same output variable between these 3 processing.

    This approach is same as FindWhetherTeeIsBalanced.java.
    Every node is processed repeatedly.

    This is called BRUTE FORCE approach:
    In Brute Force approach, we just look at all possible paths.
    To do this, we traverse to each node. At each node, we recursively try all paths downwards, tracking the sum as we go.
    As soon as we hit our target sum, we increment the total.

    Brute Force concept is same for finding substring in a string or finding an element in an array etc.

    On each level of recursion tree, we compare N nodes. If a tree is balanced, then runtime complexity is O(n log n).
    For unbalanced tree, it can be O(n^2).

                        cpws(n, 8)
                        cpws(n,8,0)         --- total n nodes are visited

               cpws(n/2,8)            cpws(n/2,8)
               cpws(n/2,8,0)          cpws(n/2,8,0) --- total n nodes are visited

          cpws(n/4,8)   cpws(n/4,8)         cpws(,/4,8)
          cpws(n/4,8,0) cpws(n/4,8,0)       cpws(n/4,8,0)


    You can optimize it by avoiding Brute Force approach and traversing every node just once.
    This is the same problem as FindWhetherTreeIsBalanced.java
