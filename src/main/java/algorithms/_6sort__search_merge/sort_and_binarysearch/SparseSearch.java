/*
    Given a sorted array of strings that is interspersed with empty strings, write an algorithm to find the location of a given string.
    array=["at","","","","ball","","","car","","","dad","',""];

    As soon as think of sorted array, Binary Search should come to mind.
    Here, the only caveat is array has empty strings, so if found middle element is "", then move middle to closet left or right element in array.
